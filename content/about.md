# Many clubs, one community.
jku.community is where student organizations live, breathe, and get discovered. Our board? Students like you, making decisions that actually matter for the clubs that create the best experiences on campus. Think of us as your club HQ: one platform to rule them all! Where you can discover every student organization, see what they're about, and find your own community at JKU.

## What We Built
A directory that should have existed long before. No more "wait, we have a ___ club?" moments. Explore all the clubs, find out how to get involved, create more memories at JKU!

## Who Benefits
**Students**: Browse clubs by interest, vibe, or pure curiosity. Your community is here! You just haven't met them yet.

**Clubs**: Stop being JKU's best-kept secret. Get found by the students who've been looking for you!

**Professor? Company? Institution?** Direct line to engaged student communities ready to collaborate, learn, or build something together.

Built by students, for students. Maintained by students who care about this stuff.
