# The Problem

Ever since I started studying, I've heard these sentences a lot:
- "I never heard about this association"
- "I wish there was a club for XYZ"
- "Why isn't there a website for all the clubs?"

# The Solution

This website should be the answer to all the questions above. **It should be _the_ directory of all clubs at JKU and Linz.** In the future, we can also add support for listing events, as this is also a common problem that I and many others are often facing.


# You can help! ðŸš€

This project is [open source](https://github.com/0xa-at/jku.community) and accepts contributions from everyone. If you want to add a club or new features, just create an issue or open a pull request!
